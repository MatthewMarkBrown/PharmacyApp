# Pharmacy App

Problem Specification
Pharmacies in undeveloped areas do not have an efficient systems to keep track of their product shipment, there point of sales system is a problem because it is time consuming the way they handle the point sales. 
They have the old school tellers which is outdated. There is no sign of staff information as well which can be a problem because if there are any problems it can be easily handled once the staff information is present. 
Customer information is another problem because pharmacies accept any customer with no knowledge at all who the customer is. Placing orders is outdated because everything is done on paper. 
So basically there entire systems is outdated

Solution
I would like to solve this problem by creating a system that will have all this information and more at hand. Everything will be connected in a way that it will be easy and efficient to handle for the user.
